;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Easily use and navigate multiple shell buffers, including remote shells.
;; Fundamentally, multishell is the function `multishell-pop-to-shell' -
;; a la `pop-to-buffer' - plus a keybinding. Together, they enable you to:
;;
;; * Get to the input point from wherever you are in a shell buffer,
;;   ... or to any of your shell buffers, from anywhere inside emacs.
;;
;; * Use universal arguments to launch and choose among alternate shell buffers,
;;   ... and change which is the current default.
;;
;; * Easily restart disconnected shells, or shells from prior sessions
;;   ... the latter from Emacs builtin savehist minibuf history persistence
;;
;; * Append a path to a new shell name to launch a shell in that directory,
;;   ... and use a path with Emacs tramp syntax to launch a remote shell -
;;   for example:
;;
;;   * `#root/sudo:root@localhost:/etc` for a buffer named "*#root*" with a
;;     root shell starting in /etc.
;;
;;   * `/ssh:example.net:` for a shell buffer in your homedir on example.net.
;;     The buffer will be named "*example.net*".
;;
;;   * `#ex/ssh:example.net|sudo:root@example.net:/var/log` for a root shell
;;     starting in /var/log on example.net named "*#ex*".
;;
;;   * 'interior/ssh:gateway.corp.com|ssh:interior.corp.com:' to go via
;;     gateway.corp.com to your homedir on interior.corp.com.  The buffer
;;     will be named "*interior*". You could append a sudo hop, and so on.
;;
;; * Thanks to tramp, file visits from the shell will seamlessly be in
;;   the auspices of the target account, and relative to the current
;;   directory, on the host where the shell is running.
;;
;; * Manage your list of shells, current and past, as a collection.
;;
;; See the `multishell-pop-to-shell' docstring for details.
;;
;; Customize-group `multishell' to select and activate a keybinding and set
;; various behaviors. Customize-group `savehist' to preserve buffer
;; names/paths across emacs restarts.
;;
;; Please use
;; [the multishell repository](https://github.com/kenmanheimer/EmacsMultishell)
;; issue tracker to report problems, suggestions, etc, and see that
;; repository for a bit more documentation.
;;
;; Change Log:
;;
;; * 2022-06-04 1.1.10 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - Get basic multishell command-key customization working.
;; * 2020-10-30 1.1.9 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - Require cl-lib when compiling for cl-letf macro.
;; * 2020-10-28 1.1.8 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - Change back to having multishell-list require multishell,
;;     rather than the other way around, and remove now unnecessary
;;     new autoloads.
;;   - Bump version for ELPA release.
;; * 2020-10-28 1.1.7 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - Forward compatibility: 'cl-progv' rather than 'progv', resolves
;;     multishell-list error in recent emacs versions.
;;   - Incorporate gnu refinements (thanks!)
;; * 2016-06-27 1.1.6 Ken Manheimer (unreleased):
;;   - When starting a remote shell, if cd fails to an inital remote
;;     directory, try again without the cd.
;; * 2016-02-11 1.1.5 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - Rectify multishell list sorting to preserve recentness
;;   - Increment the actual multishell-version setting, neglected for 1.1.4.
;; * 2016-02-11 1.1.4 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - hookup multishell-list as completion help buffer.
;;     Mouse and keyboard selections from help listing properly exits
;;     minibuffer.
;; * 2016-02-09 1.1.3 Ken Manheimer:
;;   multishell-list:
;;   - add some handy operations, like cloning new entry from existing
;;   - add optional behaviors to existing operations for returning to
;;     stopped shells without restarting them.
;;   - solidify maintaining focus on current entry
;;   - fix miscellaneous.
;; * 2016-01-31 1.1.2 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - Settle puzzling instability of multishell-all-entries
;;     - The accumulations was putting items going from more to less active
;;       categories to be put at the end, not beginning.
;;     - Also, using history for prompting changes history - implement
;;       no-record option to avoid this when needed.
;;   - Implement simple edit-in-place multishell-replace-entry and use in
;;     multishell-list-edit-entry.
;;   - Remove now unnecessary multishell-list-revert-buffer-kludge.
;;   - Rectify byte compiler offenses, and other fixes - thanks to Stefan
;;     Monnier for pointing out many of the corrections.
;;   - Avoid directly calling tramp functions unnecessarily.
;; * 2016-01-30 1.1.1 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - shake out initial multishell-list glitches:
;;     - (Offer to) delete shell buffer, if present, when deleting entry.
;;     - Set recency (numeric rank) as initial sort field
;;     - Recompute list on most operations that affect the order, and try to
;;       preserve stability. (Kludgy solution, needs work.)
;;   - Set version to 1.1.1 - multishell-list addition should have been 1.1.0.
;; * 2016-01-30 1.0.9 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - Add multishell-list for managing the collection of current and
;;     history-registered shells: edit, delete, and switch/pop to entries.
;;     Easy access by invoking `multishell-pop-to-shell' from in the
;;     `multishell-pop-to-shell' universal arg prompts.
;;   - Duplicate existing shell buffer names in completions, for distinction.
;;   - Add paths to buffers started without one, when multishell history dir
;;     tracking is enabled.
;;   - Major code cleanup:
;;     - Simplify multishell-start-shell-in-buffer, in particular using
;;       shell function, rather than unnecessarily going underneath it.
;;     - Establish multishell-name-from-entry as canonical name resolver.
;;     - Fallback to eval-after-load in emacs versions that lack
;;       with-eval-after-load (eg, emacs 23).
;;     - save-match-data, where match-string is used
;;     - resituate some helpers
;; * 2016-01-24 1.0.8 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - Work around the shell/tramp mishandling of remote+sudo+homedir problem!
;;     The work around is clean and simple, basically using high-level `cd'
;;     API and not messing with the low-level default-directory setting.
;;     (Turns out the problem was not in my local config. Good riddance to the
;;     awkward failure handler!)
;;   - Clean up code resolving the destination shell, starting to document the
;;     decision tree in the process. See getting-to-a-shell.md in the
;;     multishell repository, https://github.com/kenmanheimer/EmacsMultishell
;;   - There may be some shake-out on resolving the destination shell, but
;;     this release gets the fundamental functionality soundly in place.
;; * 2016-01-23 1.0.7 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - Remove notes about tramp remote+sudo+homedir problem. Apparently it's
;;     due to something in my local site configuration (happens with -q but
;;     not -Q).
;; * 2016-01-22 1.0.6 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - Add multishell-version function.
;;   - Tweak commentary/comments/docstrings.
;;   - Null old multishell-buffer-name-history var, if present.
;; * 2016-01-16 1.0.5 Ken Manheimer:
;;   - History now includes paths, when designated.
;;   - Actively track current directory in history entries that have a path.
;;     Custom control: multishell-history-entry-tracks-current-directory
;;   - Offer to remove shell's history entry when buffer is killed.
;;     (Currently the only UI mechanism to remove history entries.)
;;   - Fix - prevent duplicate entries for same name but different paths
;;   - Fix - recognize and respect tramp path syntax to start in home dir
;;   - Simplify history var name, migrate existing history if any from old name
;; * 2016-01-04 1.0.4 Ken Manheimer - Released to ELPA
;; * 2016-01-02 Ken Manheimer - working on this in public, but not yet released.
;;
;; TODO and Known Issues:
;;
;; * Add custom shell launch prep actions
;;   - for, eg, port knocking, interface activations
;;   - shell commands to execute when shell name or path matches a regexp
;;   - list of (regexp, which - name, path, or both, command)
;; * Investigate whether we can recognize and provide for failed hops.
;;   - Tramp doesn't provide useful reactions for any hop but the first
;;   - Might be stuff we can do to detect and convey failures?
;;   - Might be no recourse but to seek tramp changes.
;; * Try minibuffer field boundary at beginning of tramp path, to see whether
;;   the field boundary magically enables tramp path completion.

  "Easily navigate to and within multiple shell buffers, local and remote.

Use a single `universal-argument' (\\[universal-argument]) to launch and choose between
nalternate shell buffers, and a doubled universal argument to also set your
choice as the ongoing default.  Append a path to a new shell name to launch
a shell in that directory, and use Emacs tramp syntax to launch a remote
shell. There is a shortcut to manage your list of current and
historical shells, collectively, using `multishell-list' - see below.

Customize-group `multishell' to set up a key binding and tweak behaviors.

Manage your collection of current and historical shells by
recursively invoking \\[multishell-pop-to-shell] at the `multishell-pop-to-shell'
universal argument prompts, eg:

  \\[universal-argument] \\[multishell-pop-to-shell] \\[multishell-pop-to-shell]

\(That will be just a few keys if you do the above customization.)

Hit ? in the listing buffer for editing commands.

==== Basic operation:

 - If the current buffer is in shell-mode then focus is moved to
   the process input point.

   \(Use a universal argument go to a different shell buffer
   when already in a buffer that has a process - see below.)

 - If not in a shell buffer, go to a window that is already
   showing a shell buffer, if any.

   In this case, the cursor is not moved to the process input
   point. Repeating the command once you're in the buffer will
   then move the cursor to the process input point.

   We respect `pop-up-windows', so you can adjust it to set the
   other-buffer/same-buffer behavior.

 - Otherwise, start a new shell buffer, using the current
   directory as the working directory.

If a buffer with the resulting name exists and its shell process
was disconnected or otherwise stopped, it's resumed.

===== Universal arg to start and select between named shell buffers:

You can assign a distinct name to new shell buffers by prefixing
your \\[multishell-pop-to-shell] invocation with a single or double
`universal-argument', \\[universal-argument]:

 - With a single universal argument, prompt for the buffer name
   to use (without the asterisks that shell mode will put around
   the name), defaulting to `shell'.

   Completion is available.

   This combination makes it easy to start and switch across
   multiple shell restarts.

 - A double universal argument will prompt for the name and set
   the default to that name, so the target shell becomes the
   primary.

   See `multishell-primary-name' for info about preserving the
   setting across emacs restarts.

 - Manage your collection of current and historical shells by
   recursively invoking \\[multishell-pop-to-shell] at the `multishell-pop-to-shell'
   universal argument prompts, or at any time via
   \\[multishell-list]. Hit ? in the listing buffer for editing
   commands.

===== Select starting directory and remote host:

The shell buffer name you give to the prompt for a universal arg
can include an appended path. That will be used for the startup
directory. You can use tramp remote syntax to specify a remote
shell. If there is an element after a final `/', that's used for
the buffer name. Otherwise, the host, domain, or path is used.

For example:

* `#root/sudo:root@localhost:/etc' for a buffer named \"*#root*\" with a
  root shell starting in /etc.

* `/ssh:example.net:' for a shell buffer in your homedir on example.net.
  The buffer will be named \"*example.net*\".

* `#ex/ssh:example.net|sudo:root@example.net:/var/log' for a root shell
  starting in /var/log on example.net named \"*#ex*\".

* `interior/ssh:gateway.corp.com|ssh:interior.corp.com:' to go
  via gateway.corp.com to your homedir on interior.corp.com.  The
  buffer will be named \"*interior*\". You could append a sudo
  hop to the path, combining the previous example, and so on.

File visits from the shell, and many common emacs activities like
dired, will be on the host where the shell is running, in the
auspices of the target account, and relative to the current
directory.

You can change the startup path for a shell buffer by editing it
at the completion prompt. The new path will not take effect for
an already-running shell.

To remove a shell buffer's history entry, kill the buffer and
affirm removal of the entry when prompted.

===== Activate savehist to retain shell buffer names and paths across Emacs restarts:

To have emacs maintain your history of shell buffer names and paths,
customize the savehist group to activate savehist."
